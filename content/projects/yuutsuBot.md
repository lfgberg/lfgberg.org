This was a Discord Bot developed with Node.JS to serve various different keyboard utilities. Including but not limited to displaying different mounting styles, switches, etc. in a graphic format. It uses an event-handling system to perform different actions when messages are sent, reactions are added, etc. There's also a karma and leveling system to encourage user activity. This was created before Discord implemented the "slash command" system, and is now mostly deprecated.
