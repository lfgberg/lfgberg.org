# About Me
I'm a Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations Major at Penn State University Park expecting to graduate in 2025. Apart from being a full-time student working multiple jobs, I'm extremely passionate about SCUBA and underwater photography. I also maintain various personal projects such as the design of various mechanical keyboards.

# What I do

## Competitive Cybersecurity Organization
In addition to my coursework, I'm the Secretary and Defensive Captain of the [Competitive Cybersecurity Organization (CCSO)](https://ccso.psu.edu/). I create and plan meetings, organize and run teams for defensive cybersecurity competitions, and manage other ad hoc projects such as our merchandise. CCSO brought me together with amazing friends, and provided wonderful opportunities to travel and compete against other institutions.

## Learning Assistant - IST242
I currently serve as a Learning Assistant for IST242, Intermediate Object Oriented Design and Software Applications. In addition to grading and providing feedback on programming assignments, I regularly hold office hours and provide a 1:1 environment for students to get help with the course.

## Lynnhaven Dive Center
I've been diving since age 10 with LDC, and now serve as a full-time sales associate, and divemaster during the summer. As a divemaster I lead open water dives, assist with course instruction, and work with individuals in the water. As someone who's passionate about the underwater world I enjoy sharing my experience with others and helping them along their own SCUBA adventures.
