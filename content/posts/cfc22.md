This was my second year as a participant in the DOE's Cyberforce Competition, but my first as a team captain for CCSO. Placing third the year before I felt as though there was a fairly large expectation to live up to, but I was excited nonetheless. Cyberforce is fairly unique in its format and multifaceted approach, requiring a significant amount of preparation before competition day, and different varieties of deliverables ranging from Executive Briefs to a day of CTF.

## Takeaways

Our weakest components of this competition were incident response and our C-Suite Briefing. Although we'd implemented the Elastic Stack, the majority of our team lacked enough practice with the tool to be able to effectively use it. Cyberforce's assumed breach model of Red Team assessments makes it fairly easy to identify attacks, but moving forward we'll need to focus on recognizing TTPs and constructing valid narratives with sufficient evidence.
