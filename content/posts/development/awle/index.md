## Background

The AWLE is a leadership exercise put on by Penn State's Airforce ROTC Detachment once per semester. It's an exercise meant to test knowledge of their curriculum content, and effective leadership and followership from participants. I lead a joint effort between the [Competitive Cybersecurity Organization](https://ccso.psu.edu/), and AFROTC, to create the Fall 2022 AWLE.

## Implementation

We used [Twine](https://twinery.org/), a choose your own adventure story building tool to create a quiz-style game in which participants needed to work through 3 different training scenarios. Participants were presented with a series of challenges in a random order and had to choose the best Airforce inventory to complete given tasks. There was also a reporting system to break down what tasks they did and did not complete within 3 tries. The finished product can be viewed [here](https://awle.lfgberg.org).
